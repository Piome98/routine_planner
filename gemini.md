## Fixing Log (2025-08-31)

- **Action:** Ran `dart analyze` and fixed all reported errors and warnings.
- **Files Modified:**
  - `lib/screens/calendar_spa_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/task_spa_screen.dart`
- **Summary of Changes:**
  - **Type Mismatches:** Corrected an issue where an `EventType` enum was expected but a `String` was provided. The code was updated to consistently use `String` for event types, resolving `undefined_class`, `undefined_getter`, and `body_might_complete_normally` errors in `calendar_spa_screen.dart`.
  - **Syntax Errors:** Fixed multiple `missing_identifier` and `expected_token` errors in both files by correcting the list spread syntax from the invalid `..[` to the correct `...[`.
  - **Unused Code:** Removed an unused `_selectedFilter` variable and its associated UI logic in `task_spa_screen.dart` to fix an `unused_field` warning.
  - **Redundant Code:** Removed a redundant `width: 1` argument from a `Border.all` constructor in `task_spa_screen.dart` to resolve an `avoid_redundant_argument_values` message.

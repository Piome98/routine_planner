# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Build & Run:**
- `flutter run` - Run the app in debug mode
- `flutter build apk` - Build Android APK
- `flutter build ios` - Build iOS app (macOS only)

**Testing & Analysis:**
- `flutter test` - Run unit and widget tests
- `flutter analyze` - Run static analysis using rules from analysis_options.yaml
- `dart fix --apply` - Apply automatic fixes for lint issues

**Dependencies:**
- `flutter pub get` - Install dependencies from pubspec.yaml
- `flutter pub upgrade` - Upgrade all dependencies

**Code Generation (if using build_runner):**
- `dart run build_runner build` - Generate code files

## Architecture

This is a Flutter routine/task management app with Firebase backend integration.

**Core Architecture:**
- **State Management:** Provider pattern for dependency injection and state management
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication + Firestore NoSQL database)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth with email/password
- **Data Layer:** Repository pattern via FirestoreService

**Project Structure:**
- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point with Firebase initialization and Provider setup
- `lib/models/` - Data models (User, Routine, Task, Event) with Firestore serialization
- `lib/services/` - Business logic layer (AuthService, FirestoreService)
- `lib/screens/` - UI screens including main layout and dashboard
- `lib/widgets/` - Reusable UI components including sidebar navigation

**Database Schema (Firestore):**
- `users/{uid}` - User profiles
- `users/{uid}/routines/{routineId}` - User's routines
- `users/{uid}/routines/{routineId}/tasks/{taskId}` - Tasks within routines
- `users/{uid}/events/{eventId}` - User's events/todos

**Key Dependencies:**
- Firebase: `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`
- Social Auth: `google_sign_in`, `flutter_facebook_auth`
- State Management: `provider`
- Utilities: `intl` for internationalization

**Authentication Flow:**
AuthWrapper → AuthPage (login/signup toggle) → MainLayout (authenticated with sidebar navigation)
- Supports email/password, Google, and Facebook authentication

**Firebase Setup:**
The app uses Firebase with configuration files already present:
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `lib/firebase_options.dart`

**UI Architecture:**
The app features a modern dashboard-style interface with:
- **MainLayout:** Primary app layout with sidebar + content area structure
- **Sidebar:** Navigation menu with user profile, nav items, and dynamic routine list
- **DashboardScreen:** Main dashboard with personalized greeting, today's routines, upcoming events, and quick stats
- **Modular Screens:** Separate screens for Dashboard, Routines, Events, and Statistics accessible via sidebar

**Design System:**
- **Color Scheme:** Indigo primary (`#4F46E5`), with purple accents and semantic colors
- **Layout:** Card-based design with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Typography:** Clean hierarchy with proper font weights and spacing
- **Interactive Elements:** Hover states, loading indicators, and form validation
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop and mobile layouts

**Key UI Components:**
- `Sidebar` - Navigation with routine management and user profile
- `_AddRoutineDialog` - Full-featured routine creation modal
- Task completion toggles with visual feedback
- Event type badges and status indicators
- Quick stats cards with color-coded metrics

**Development Notes:**
- Use `debugPrint()` instead of `print()` for logging
- All models have `fromFirestore()` and `toFirestore()` methods
- User data is stored in subcollections under individual user documents
- The app follows Material 3 design principles with custom styling
- Real-time data updates via Firestore streams
- Form validation and error handling throughout UI components
